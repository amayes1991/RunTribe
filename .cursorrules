# Cursor Rules for RunTribe Project

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack running community application with:
- Backend: .NET 8 Web API with Entity Framework Core and SQLite
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth.js

## File Organization
- Backend code is in `RunTribe.Api/`
- Frontend code is in `runtribe/`
- Database file: `RunTribe.Api/RunTribeDb.db`

## Coding Conventions

### Backend (.NET)
- Use C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables)
- Controllers should follow RESTful conventions
- Models should use data annotations for validation
- Use async/await for database operations
- Follow Entity Framework Core best practices

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Use JavaScript/JSX with modern ES6+ syntax
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive design
- Use NextAuth.js for authentication

## Key Patterns
- API endpoints in `RunTribe.Api/Controllers/`
- Data models in `RunTribe.Api/Models/`
- Database context in `RunTribe.Api/DbContext/`
- Frontend pages in `runtribe/app/`
- Static assets in `runtribe/public/`

## Common Tasks
- When adding new features, consider both backend API and frontend UI
- Database changes require Entity Framework migrations
- Authentication flows involve both NextAuth.js and JWT tokens
- API responses should follow consistent JSON structure

## Dependencies
- Backend: .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, SQLite
- Frontend: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js
- Development: ESLint, PostCSS

## Database Schema
Main entities: Users, Groups, GroupMembers, Meetups, Posts, Comments, Cities
Relationships: Many-to-many between Users and Groups, one-to-many for Posts/Comments
